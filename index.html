        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          In my years as a computer science student, I have become proficient in programming languages such as Java, Python, C#, and JavaScript. I have also learned front-end technologies, such as React and Three.js, that help to make better and more useful applications. I have a drive to learn quickly and make an impact at every job. These are qualities that I believe would be beneficial as a Software Engineer.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am a new college graduate, from the University of Illinois, Springfield, looking for a full time job as a Software Engineer. I currently work at our local YMCA as the Director of Youth and Development and volunteer as the Software Engineering Intern. This internship has been a great experience to put my skills to use and learn new technologies in my studies.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have a passion for new technologies and computers. They facinate me in their complexities, and I strive to learn all I can while working to unravel those mysteries and be the best developer I can be!
