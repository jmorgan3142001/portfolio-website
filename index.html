        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a software engineer currently in my first year of professional programming since earning my Bachelor's in Computer Science. I have been amazed by the vast possibilities and opportunities that software engineering has to offer. My passion for coding and problem-solving led me to this career path, and I am continuously striving to learn and improve my skills.        
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that being a great programmer requires constant learning, and I am always looking for ways to enhance my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. I am a self-starter and a fast learner, always willing to take on new challenges and projects that push me out of my comfort zone.        
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my first year as a programmer and my years in university, I have gained valuable experience in various programming languages, including Java, Python, C++, C#, PHP, JavaScript, SQL, and many more. I have also developed skills in software development methodologies and have worked on projects in both front-end and back-end development.        
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a strong team player and enjoy collaborating with colleagues to achieve project goals. I am also keen on sharing my knowledge and learning from others, as I believe that a diverse range of perspectives is key to creating successful software products.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy working on personal coding projects and working with technology. I am passionate about programming and its potential to improve our lives, and I believe that software engineering is the perfect way to make a positive impact on the world.

        <h2>Work History</h2>

        <h3>Computer Programmer and Software Developer</h3>
        <h4>District 186</h4>

        <p>
          Working as a full stack developer, I would use PHP, Javascript, and Oracle SQL
          to make programs to collect, organize, and produce student, parents, and staff
          information in a logical manner. My biggest project was improving and
          updating the student registration software, to improve the structure and flow
          of the webpage. I also created a new program for after school student
          registration separate from the existing registration program.
        </p>

        <h3>Software Engineering Intern</h3>
        <h4>YMCA</h4>

        <p>
          Working closely with the CTO, I worked to improve the working order of the organization’s website and network. Using my knowledge of HTML and CSS, I enhance existing web pages and build new ones with better functionality and form. I have also researched and completed various automation tasks using Python and C#.
